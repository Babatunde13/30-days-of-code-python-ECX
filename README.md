# ECX Python challenge
Engineering Career Expo(ECX) is an organization which teaches students how to code in Python, Front End(HTML, CSS and JS), Back End(NOde JS) and carry out UI/UX & Engineering Design. Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, a 30 days of code and design challenge was initiated to ensure that students keep learning. In this challenge students are to carry out daily tasks of ranging difficulties depending on the track. I have in this repo my codes from day 0 to day 29.
