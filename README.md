# ECX Python challenge
Engineering Career Expo(ECX) is an organization which teaches students how to code in Python, Front End(HTML, CSS and JS), Back End(NOde JS), Engineering Design and UI/UX. Due to the COVID-19 outbreak in the world, they decided to create a 30 days of code challenge so as to build her students. In this challenge you're to do some basic things depending on your track.
I have in this repo my codes from day 0 to day 29.
